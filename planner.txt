Proper Planning Prevents Piss Poor Performance

Yev:
    My understanding of the system is that every element I of the list has three (really four) components:
        Integer component
        Double component
        String component
        Type
    Type denotes which of the components is relevant; 
        e.g. if some element at index 2 has 1, 2.718, "Oiler", and the type value at index 2 is 2, the relevant element is "Oiler".
    The add method poulates each component (including type).
    The expand method expands all four arrays.

    ToString, will, for each element, use the type to select from the correct array,
        e.g. in a list instance containing:
            intElements -> [0,2,1,1,10]
            doubleElements -> [2.718, 1.619, 1.411, 3.141, 6.674]
            stringElements -> ["Euler", "Phi", "Diag", "Arc", "Grav"]
            typeOfElements -> [2, 2, 0, 1, 1]
        The String representation of this list will be: [Euler, Phi, 1, 3.141, 6.674],
        corresponding to [type 2 at index 0, type 2 at index 1, type 0 at index 2, type 1 at index 3, type 1 at index 4]
